## The Kinetics of Clearance: PFAS, Plastics, and Persistent Pollutants

While heavy metals play a big role in the conversation around environmental toxicity, non-metal toxicants present an arguably more complex physiological challenge. These toxicants span distinct families that behave differently within biological systems.

To develop a coherent strategy for clearance, we must first understand the specific **storage dynamics** of the target compounds. We cannot mobilize what we cannot locate.

### The Storage Partition: Fat vs. Protein

The conventional wisdom is that toxins are stored in fat. While true for many legacy pollutants, it is now incomplete.

* **Lipophilic (Fat-Loving):** Dioxins, PCBs, Phthalates, and Bisphenol A (BPA) partition into adipose tissue. They are sequestered in the body's lipid reservoirs, creating a "silent" burden that is only mobilized during lipolysis (fat loss).
* **Proteinophilic (Protein-Loving):** Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) behave differently. They do not hide in fat; they bind to serum proteins (primarily albumin) and accumulate in highly perfused organs like the liver, kidneys, and lungs.

This distinction is critical because the method of extraction must match the method of storage.

### Class I: The Lipophilic Burden (Dioxins, PCBs, Plastics)

*Targets: Dioxins, PCBs, Phthalates, BPA*

For these compounds, the "sink" is adipose tissue. The half-life of dioxins in the human body is estimated around 7 years. To clear them, we must induce mobilization (lipolysis) and then ensure excretion via sweat or stool.

#### Mechanism 1: Dermal Excretion (The BUS Protocol)

Sweating appears to be a uniquely effective pathway for bypassing the liver and kidney bottlenecks for *specific* plasticizers. Research by the Genuis group has documented that for certain non-metal toxicants, sweat may be a more efficient route of elimination than urine.

* **Phthalates:** A [2012 study](https://doi.org/10.1100/2012/615068) found MEHP (a phthalate metabolite) concentrations in sweat were more than twice as high as in urine. In several individuals, the parent compound DEHP appeared in sweat but not in serum, suggesting tissue retention that standard blood testing would miss.
* **BPA:** A [companion study](https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/185731) found BPA in the sweat of 16 out of 20 participants, including some individuals with no detectable BPA in serum or urine. The authors concluded that induced sweating "appears to be a potential method for elimination of BPA."
* **Microplastics:** While direct evidence for sweating out microplastic *particles* is emerging, the chemical additives associated with them (plasticizers) are readily excreted via this route.

#### Mechanism 2: Intercepting Enterohepatic Circulation

Dioxins are primarily excreted via the bile into the feces. However, they are frequently reabsorbed in the gut (enterohepatic circulation). To prevent this, we can use non-absorbable lipophilic binders.

* **The "Olestra" Effect:** In a [1999 case report](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04271-3), two patients with severe dioxin poisoning were given Olestra, a non-absorbable fat substitute. The intervention accelerated intestinal excretion of TCDD (the most toxic dioxin congener) by eight- to ten-fold, potentially reducing the elimination half-life from approximately 7 years to 1–2 years. A [follow-up study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-002-0345-7) confirmed the effect, though noted that for patients with already-shortened half-lives due to high exposure, the relative benefit was smaller.
* **Practical Application:** While Olestra is rarely used now, the principle holds: increasing insoluble fiber or using specific bile acid sequestrants (like cholestyramine or activated charcoal) can prevent the reabsorption of mobilized lipophilic toxins.

### Class II: The Proteinophilic Burden (PFAS)

*Targets: PFOS, PFOA ("Forever Chemicals")*

PFAS presents a unique kinetic problem. Because they bind to albumin in the blood and recycle through the kidneys (via transport proteins), they have half-lives of up to several years. Unlike BPA, they are *not* efficiently excreted in sweat.

A [2013 study](https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/483832) from the same research group that documented sweat excretion of phthalates and BPA found strikingly different results for PFAS. Despite detecting substantial levels of PFHxS, PFOS, and PFOA in serum, "minimal to none" appeared in sweat or urine. The authors concluded that "induced perspiration through sauna or exercise does not seem to hasten the clearance of these three common PFCs from the human body." This finding underscores how the proteinophilic binding behavior of PFAS renders sweating-based interventions ineffective for this compound class. However, a mechanical intervention has shown rigorous efficacy.

#### The Plasma Donation Protocol

Since PFAS circulates bound to serum proteins, physically removing serum is the most direct clearance method.

* **The Evidence:** A [2022 randomized clinical trial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.6257) enrolled 285 Australian firefighters with elevated PFOS levels and assigned them to donate plasma every 6 weeks, donate blood every 12 weeks, or serve as observation controls. After 12 months, plasma donation reduced mean serum PFOS by 2.9 ng/mL (roughly 30%), while blood donation achieved a 1.1 ng/mL reduction. The observation group showed no significant change. Plasma donation proved more effective, likely because each donation removes a larger volume of the albumin-rich fraction where PFAS concentrates.
* **The Mechanism:** This effectively "drains the reservoir," forcing the body to equilibrate extravascular PFAS back into the blood, where it can be removed in subsequent donations.

### Class III: The Particulate Burden (Microplastics)

*Targets: Physical micro/nanoplastic fragments*

Microplastics act less like dissolved chemicals and more like foreign bodies. They accumulate in the liver, spleen, and gut lining. Currently, there is no proven "chelation" for physical plastic particles. The strategy here shifts from *removal* to *mitigation*.

* **Mitigation of Oxidative Stress:** Microplastics induce damage primarily through oxidative stress and inflammation. Emerging research suggests that antioxidants (like Vitamin E and C) can mitigate the cellular damage caused by these particles, even if they do not directly remove them.
* **Autophagy:** There is theoretical support for upregulation of autophagy (via fasting or caloric restriction) to help cells clear intracellular debris, though specific clinical trials on microplastics are still upcoming.

## Open Questions

**PFAS**: Does reducing levels actually improve health?

This is perhaps the central unanswered question in the field. We now have robust evidence that both [plasma donation](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.6257) and [cholestyramine treatment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2024.108497) can significantly reduce serum PFAS concentrations. The Danish cholestyramine trial achieved a striking 60% reduction in PFOS over 12 weeks. Yet no study has demonstrated that these reductions translate into improved clinical outcomes.

But health improvement does seem plausible: PFAS exposure has been associated with kidney and testicular cancers, elevated cholesterol, reduced vaccine response, and pregnancy complications. If the dose-response relationship holds in both directions, lowering the body burden should reduce risk. But biological systems are not always reversible, and we lack data on whether damage already incurred can be mitigated by subsequent clearance.

The [Firefighter Collaborative Research Project](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05869747), with results expected in late 2025, is specifically designed to bridge this gap by tracking epigenetic age acceleration, cardiovascular risk markers, and cognitive function alongside PFAS levels. Until these results emerge, we are optimizing a biomarker without confirmation that doing so confers clinical benefit.

**PFAS**: Can bile acid sequestrants become practical interventions?

Cholestyramine's side effect profile (gastrointestinal distress, interference with nutrient absorption) makes it unsuitable for widespread or prolonged use. A [Swedish follow-up study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2025.109794) confirmed that colesevelam, a related bile acid sequestrant, also accelerates PFAS elimination. The question now is whether better-tolerated formulations or alternative enterohepatic interrupters can be developed for populations with chronic low-level exposure rather than acute contamination.

**Lipophilic toxins**: What replaces Olestra?

The Olestra research demonstrated a powerful principle: non-absorbable lipophilic binders can dramatically accelerate excretion of dioxins and PCBs by interrupting enterohepatic circulation. But Olestra is effectively unavailable. Cholestyramine can serve a similar function, but was never designed for this purpose. Is there a practical, accessible intervention that general populations could use to reduce body burdens of legacy organochlorines?

**Microplastics**: Can particles actually be cleared?

For dissolved chemicals, the body has elimination pathways. For physical particles embedded in tissue, no such pathway has been demonstrated. Research confirms that micro- and nanoplastics trigger autophagy responses in exposed cells, but whether autophagy successfully degrades or extrudes these particles remains unknown. If clearance proves impossible, the strategic question shifts entirely to mitigation: can antioxidant or anti-inflammatory interventions meaningfully reduce the damage from a burden we cannot remove?

**Microplastics**: What exposure thresholds matter?

Unlike PFAS or dioxins, where epidemiological data increasingly link specific serum concentrations to health outcomes, microplastic research lacks dose-response relationships applicable to humans. The [2024 carotid artery study](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822) found microplastics in atherosclerotic plaques and associated their presence with cardiovascular events, but could not establish whether higher particle counts mean higher risk. Standardized quantification methods and longitudinal human studies are needed before we can identify safe exposure thresholds, if any exist.
