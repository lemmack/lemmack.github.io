I'm considering starting a Master's program in 2026. And I've been thinking a lot about what I might lose in the process.

Graduate school will teach me things. It will deepen my expertise, give me credentials, connect me with people working on problems I care about. But it will also subject me to pressures. Pressures to specialize. Pressures to protect my reputation. Pressures to stop asking the kind of dumb, speculative questions that I currently ask freely.

I've started calling this the trap of knowing. The more you learn, the higher your standards for what counts as knowledge become, and the less willing you are to consider yourself a beginner who knows nothing. The paradox is that expertise, which should expand what you can contribute, often constrains it instead.

## What the research says

This pattern shows up across multiple levels.

At the cognitive level, organizational psychologist Erik Dane coined the term [cognitive entrenchment](https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.35.4.zok579): as you build expertise, your mental schemas stabilize. This lets you move fast and perform well. But stable schemas reduce flexibility. Deep expertise can impair your capacity for creative recombination when problems shift.

There's a related phenomenon called the [Einstellung effect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.02.001). Once a familiar solution comes to mind, you can become captured by it even when better solutions exist. Bilalić and colleagues demonstrated this with chess masters. Eye-tracking showed that experts kept looking at familiar moves even when they reported searching for alternatives. The first idea that comes to mind [directs attention toward consistent information and away from inconsistent information](https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721410363571). Fluency becomes a tunnel.

At the career level, Benjamin Jones has documented what he calls the [burden of knowledge](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-937X.2008.00531.x). As foundational knowledge accumulates, it takes longer to reach the frontier. Innovators respond by training longer and specializing more narrowly. [Teams increasingly dominate solo authors](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1136099) in producing high-impact research, because no single brain can hold the whole problem anymore. This has generalized across nearly all fields.

At the reputational level, the system rewards being legible inside a category. [Bromham and colleagues found](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature18315) that interdisciplinary research proposals have systematically lower funding success, even controlling for other factors. The more your work spans disparate fields, the less likely you are to get funded. Meanwhile, Merton's [Matthew Effect](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.159.3810.56) documents how eminent scientists get disproportionate credit, which makes reputation a real asset worth protecting. The graduate student who freely speculates becomes the tenured professor who hedges everything with "this is outside my area, but..."

And at the perceptual level, there's what I think of as paradigm blindness. You learn ways of seeing along with facts. The frameworks become invisible. They stop being one lens among many and start being "just how things are." Zen Buddhism has a concept for this: *shoshin*, beginner's mind. Shunryu Suzuki put it simply: "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few."

## Why I'm writing this now

I want to name these traps because I'm about to walk into a system designed to create them.

What I value most in my own thinking is the freedom to cross-pollinate. To pull on weird threads. To ask questions that might be naive or wrong. To challenge perspectives that experts have long since stopped questioning. I believe this kind of thinking has real value, and I believe we lose something important when people stop doing it.

Here's what bothers me: the incentive structures in academia actively discourage it. A highly specialized professor has built a career on being an expert in X. Speaking about Y carries reputational risk. Publishing outside your lane is harder. Funding for boundary-crossing work is scarcer. So the safest path is to stay in your box, keep asking the kinds of questions your field already knows how to answer, and gradually forget what it felt like to be a beginner who could see the whole landscape.

I feel something close to resentment toward these pressures. Once you start policing your own thinking, once you start judging which threads you're allowed to pull on, you lose intellectual value that could have been contributed to the world. And the loss is invisible, because nobody tracks the questions that never got asked.

## What I want to remember

I'm writing this as a time capsule. A note to my future self who might be neck-deep in a program, feeling the pressure to specialize, starting to internalize the standards that make speculative questions feel embarrassing.

I want to remember that cognitive entrenchment is real, and that noticing it is the first defense against it.

I want to remember that the age-30 myth about scientific genius [isn't a law of nature](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1102895108). The "young genius" image fit physics during the quantum mechanics revolution, when a paradigm shift made older knowledge suddenly less relevant. What people attribute to cognitive decline is often just training time, knowledge accumulation, and social embedding. Which means it's at least partially a choice.

I want to remember that fluency can become a tunnel. That the first idea to come to mind can blind you to better alternatives. That expertise creates the trap, even as it provides tools to escape it.

And I want to remember why I cared about any of this in the first place. The point was never to become an expert for its own sake. The point was to understand things well enough to ask better questions. To see connections that the disciplinary silos miss. To contribute something that couldn't have come from someone who stayed safely inside their lane.

If graduate school makes me more capable of that, it will have been worth it. If it makes me less capable of that, I'll have lost something I can't easily get back.

So I'm naming the trap now, while I can still see it clearly. Maybe that will help me avoid it. Or maybe I'll read this in a few years and realize I fell in anyway. Either way, at least I'll know what I was trying to protect.

P.S. I wrote this post on Christmas morning. So for anyone reading, merry Christmas, happy holidays, and all the best for the new year ahead.🎄
