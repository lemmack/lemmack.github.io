# Introduction

I have been spending time trying to understand chelation therapy at a more fundamental level. Chelation is often presented in simple terms. A toxic metal is present, so a binding agent is introduced to attach to it and facilitate removal. At first glance, this looks like a straightforward problem of chemistry and clearance.
As I have looked more closely at the pharmacology, the history of these agents, and the clinical literature, it has become clear that this framing is incomplete. Not because metal removal is misguided in principle, but because biological systems introduce layers of complexity that chemistry alone does not capture.
What follows is not an argument against chelation, nor a defense of it. It is an attempt to review the landscape. Where did chelation come from? Why have certain metals, especially mercury, attracted so much attention? How do different chelators actually differ from one another? And what do recent data clarify or fail to clarify about when metal removal is likely to help, do nothing, or cause harm?

# The “Claw” and the War Gas

The term chelation comes from the Greek chele, meaning the claw of a lobster. In coordination chemistry, a chelator is a ligand that binds a metal ion through multiple attachment points, forming a ring-like structure that stabilizes the complex and often increases its solubility and excretion. Morgan and Drew [introduced the term](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed067p530) in 1920 to describe caliper-like groups that fasten to a central atom.
The clinical use of chelators did not originate in chronic disease management. It arose in response to acute poisoning. During World War II, British researchers developed dimercaprol, also known as British Anti-Lewisite, as an antidote to Lewisite, an arsenic-based [chemical weapon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931516/).
This origin matters. Chelators were designed to compete aggressively with biological molecules for metals in life-threatening situations. Their design priorities were speed and effectiveness under acute conditions, not subtlety, compartmental control, or long-term system stability.

# Chelators Are Not a Single Class of Intervention

One source of confusion in discussions of chelation is the tendency to treat "chelators" as a uniform category. In practice, the agents grouped under this label differ substantially in chemistry, distribution, metabolism, and mechanism of action.
Some chelators, such as EDTA and DMSA, are water-soluble molecules that primarily circulate extracellularly and are cleared relatively quickly. Others, such as alpha-lipoic acid or NBMI, are more lipophilic and interact with intracellular environments, membranes, or redox systems in ways that blur the line between chelation, sequestration, and biochemical modulation.
These differences matter. The risks and potential benefits of metal removal depend not only on what is being bound, but on where binding occurs, how long it persists, and what happens to the resulting complexes. Treating chelation as a single intervention obscures these distinctions and makes it harder to reason carefully about outcomes.
This heterogeneity also complicates interpretation of clinical trial results. When a trial of EDTA chelation shows no cardiovascular benefit, that result cannot be extrapolated to lipophilic chelators with different tissue distributions. When deferiprone accelerates cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients, that finding does not generalize to agents targeting different metals or compartments. Each chelator must be evaluated on its own terms, in its specific context, which makes the evidence base harder to synthesize than it might first appear.

# Why Mercury Became Central

Two figures frequently referenced in chelation discussions are Andrew Hall Cutler and Boyd Haley. Both focused heavily on mercury, and that focus reflects a reasonable starting assumption.
Mercury occupies a distinctive position among metals. It has no known physiological role in humans, exhibits strong affinity for thiol and selenol groups, and can disrupt enzymes, mitochondrial function, and cytoskeletal elements at [low concentrations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144270/). Unlike iron, copper, or zinc, mercury is not integrated into normal metabolic pathways.
Haley, an academic chemist, emphasized mercury's biochemical reactivity, particularly its ability to inhibit [thiol-dependent enzymes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11836045/) in the nervous system. Cutler, trained as a chemical engineer, approached the problem through kinetics. He focused on how short chelator half-lives and intermittent dosing could mobilize metals without maintaining sufficient binding capacity, potentially increasing redistribution risk.
These perspectives are complementary rather than contradictory. One emphasizes biochemical vulnerability, the other control of dynamic systems. Both start from the premise that mercury behaves as a harmful exogenous substance, even if they differ in how best to manage its removal.

# DMSA and DMPS: Suboptimal Chelators?

The two most commonly used agents for mercury chelation are meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, sold as Chemet) and dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS, sold as Dimaval). Both are water-soluble dithiols that increase urinary mercury excretion and have largely replaced the older and more toxic dimercaprol (BAL) in clinical practice.
However, structural chemistry research has raised questions about how effectively these agents actually bind mercury. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, George et al. [demonstrated](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/tx049904e) that neither DMSA nor DMPS forms a true chelate ring structure with mercuric ions. Instead, they form multinuclear complexes (Hg₂L₂ and Hg₃L₃ for DMSA, Hg₂L₂ for DMPS) in which mercury bridges between molecules rather than being encircled by a single chelator.
The researchers concluded that these drugs "should be considered suboptimal for their clinical task of binding mercuric ions" and outlined design criteria for improved mercury-specific chelators. This does not mean DMSA and DMPS are ineffective. Clinical evidence shows they do increase mercury excretion. But it suggests the binding chemistry is less elegant than textbook diagrams imply, and that there may be room for molecularly superior agents.

# Alpha-Lipoic Acid Is Not a Classical Chelator

Alpha-lipoic acid occupies an unusual position in chelation discussions. It is often described as a chelator, yet it does not behave like classical chelators such as DMSA or EDTA.
ALA is a disulfide that is rapidly reduced inside cells to dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol compound that participates in [cellular redox cycling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6723188/). It is DHLA, not ALA itself, that is generally thought to possess metal-binding capability due to its two free thiol groups.
This distinction has several implications. First, any metal interactions attributed to ALA are likely occurring primarily inside cells rather than in plasma. Second, DHLA is not a stable circulating species with a clearly defined pharmacokinetic half-life. It is continuously generated and re-oxidized as part of [normal metabolism](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3654245/).
As a result, citing the plasma half-life of ALA alone provides only partial information about the kinetics relevant to metal binding. The intracellular persistence of DHLA, the fate of any DHLA-metal complexes formed, and whether such complexes are exported, transferred, or simply neutralized remain incompletely characterized in humans.
This does not negate interest in ALA. It suggests that ALA should be understood as a redox-active, metabolically entangled agent rather than a straightforward classical chelator.

# Sequencing and Compartmental Gradients: Cutler’s Core Precaution

One of Cutler's most emphasized precautions was sequencing. He argued that alpha-lipoic acid should not be introduced until after peripheral mercury burden had been reduced using chelators such as DMSA or DMPS.
The logic was explicitly compartmental. ALA is widely described as capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, whereas DMSA is generally considered to have [limited CNS penetration](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4675610/). If ALA can mobilize mercury from the brain, Cutler reasoned, then introducing it while peripheral mercury levels remain high could create a gradient that favors movement into the brain rather than out of it.
Reducing peripheral burden first was intended to strengthen the body's capacity to act as a sink, so that any mobilized mercury would preferentially exit the CNS.
At a conceptual level, this is a risk-management strategy rather than a claim of precise directional control. It attempts to avoid opening a sensitive compartment before downstream clearance capacity is established.
How well this logic maps onto real human mercury kinetics remains uncertain. Peripheral "body burden" is not a single pool, and some chelators may influence CNS levels [indirectly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11353131/) even without substantial blood-brain barrier penetration. Nonetheless, the sequencing idea highlights an important point. Chelation is not only about what binds a metal, but about when and where binding occurs.

# Combination Therapy and the Shuttler Concept

The logic behind sequencing extends to a broader therapeutic concept: combining chelators with different properties to achieve what neither can accomplish alone.
A [2018 review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010854517304435) in Coordination Chemistry Reviews articulates this as the "shuttler" principle. Water-soluble chelators like DMSA and DMPS are effective at capturing metals in extracellular fluid and promoting urinary excretion, but they have limited access to intracellular compartments, particularly in the brain. Lipophilic agents can penetrate cell membranes and mobilize metals from deep tissue stores, but may not efficiently clear those metals from the body.
The proposed solution is combination therapy: a lipophilic agent to shuttle metals from intracellular sites into circulation, paired with a hydrophilic chelator to capture and excrete them. DMPS-BAL combinations have been suggested for cases of long-term mercury exposure, and low-dose BAL may facilitate mobilization of lead from the brain during DMSA treatment.
This approach remains largely theoretical in human practice, with limited clinical trial data. But it represents a more sophisticated model than single-agent chelation and acknowledges that mobilization and excretion are distinct pharmacological challenges.

# OSR, NBMI, and the Appeal of Lipophilic Chelators

Boyd Haley's favored compound, marketed as OSR and later studied as NBMI or emeramide, reflects a different design intuition.
OSR was initially sold as a dietary supplement before the FDA [determined in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDTH2) that it did not meet the legal definition of a supplement and issued a warning letter, resulting in its removal from the market. The compound has since received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency for treatment of mercury toxicity.
In the scientific literature, NBMI appears as a lipophilic thiol chelator developed for potential protection against mercury toxicity. Preclinical studies in animal models suggest NBMI can bind mercury and [reduce toxicity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3346673/) under certain conditions. The compound has since entered regulated clinical testing in limited human contexts.
A 2024 post hoc analysis of a randomized trial in Ecuadorian gold miners with elevated urinary mercury found [significant dose-dependent reductions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37987955/) in both urinary and plasma mercury concentrations following 14 days of NBMI treatment. The study reported approximately 30% reductions in urinary mercury per mg NBMI/kg bodyweight/day, with effects persisting 30 days after treatment ended. The authors disclosed that they are small shareholders in EmeraMed, the company developing NBMI.
What matters here is not whether NBMI ultimately proves broadly effective, but that it represents a distinct strategy. Rather than relying primarily on dosing frequency to manage kinetics, NBMI aims to alter molecular properties, such as lipophilicity and binding persistence, to reduce redistribution risk. Whether safety and efficacy are best pursued through better scheduling of existing tools or through fundamentally different molecules remains an open question.

# Removal, Sequestration, and Adaptation

Even for a metal like mercury, which has no known physiological role, biological handling is not trivial. Once mercury enters the body, it is rarely left free. The organism responds by binding and sequestering it through glutathione conjugation, metallothioneins, and [selenium-associated proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452225/).
These processes reduce acute toxicity by limiting interaction with sensitive targets. As a result, the presence of mercury in a given tissue does not necessarily indicate ongoing damage, nor does it guarantee that removal will always produce immediate benefit.
Chelation has the potential to alter this balance. Mobilizing mercury from relatively inert compartments into circulation could, under some conditions, increase exposure of vulnerable tissues such as the brain. Reviews of mercury toxicology and chelation pharmacology [discuss these redistribution concerns](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19106401/), particularly in relation to compartmental gradients and timing.
None of this implies that mercury removal is undesirable. It suggests that outcomes depend on chemical form, dosing strategy, timing, and the adaptive state of the system being intervened upon.

# Clinical Trials and Their Limits

Recent clinical trials provide useful constraints, though they are often interpreted more broadly than they warrant.
The TACT2 trial examined whether EDTA chelation could reduce cardiovascular events in diabetic patients, partly through lowering lead and cadmium burden. Blood metal levels decreased substantially, confirming effective chelation, but there was no statistically significant reduction in [cardiovascular outcomes](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202455).
This result does not show that metal removal is ineffective in general. It shows that in this population, at this disease stage, and with this intervention, lowering circulating metal levels did not translate into measurable cardiovascular benefit. As one researcher involved in both TACT studies [noted](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/chelation-therapy-toxic-heavy-metals), the inability to replicate earlier findings may partly reflect that blood lead levels are now much lower than they were decades ago, changing the baseline conditions under which chelation might help.
Similarly, a trial of deferiprone in early Alzheimer's disease demonstrated reduced brain iron on MRI but unexpectedly [faster cognitive decline](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-021-00821-8) in the treatment group. This finding raises questions about the role of iron in neurodegeneration and the timing of intervention rather than offering a blanket verdict on chelation.
Together, these studies underscore a recurring theme. Demonstrating that a chelator changes metal levels is not the same as demonstrating that it improves clinical outcomes.

# Pharmacokinetics Revisited

Kinetics remain central to any chelation strategy.
EDTA has a plasma half-life on the order of [tens of minutes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7053193/). Succimer (DMSA) is eliminated [within a few hours](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16627363/) in humans.
For alpha-lipoic acid, the situation is more complex. While ALA itself has a short plasma half-life, its reduced form, DHLA, is generated intracellularly and participates in ongoing redox cycling. Any metal-binding attributed to ALA is therefore tied to intracellular dynamics rather than persistence of the parent compound in circulation.
This complicates simple half-life comparisons and reinforces the idea that chelation kinetics cannot be reduced to a single number.

# Expanding the Design Space

Much of the chelation debate implicitly treats the problem as binary. Either metals should be removed or they should not. The emerging picture suggests a wider design space, with several distinct strategic approaches.
**Interception rather than mobilization**. Some approaches aim to prevent metal absorption rather than extract metals already deposited in tissues. Red-blood-cell-membrane ["nanosponges"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2013.161) have been developed to act as circulating decoys that bind toxins and are cleared by the liver, reducing exposure without drawing material out of deep tissue stores. While current work targets biological toxins rather than metals, the design principles are relevant.
**Gut-level binding**. Certain probiotic strains can bind metals and reduce intestinal absorption in experimental settings. Research on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 has shown the strain can [reduce translocation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6546314/) of lead and cadmium across intestinal epithelium models. A pilot study in pregnant Tanzanian women found that those consuming probiotic yogurt had stable or reduced blood mercury and arsenic levels, while [control groups showed continued increases](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4196227/). A 2025 systematic review found evidence that some Lactobacillus strains can [convert methylated mercury](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11915010/) into inorganic mercury and then to elemental mercury, a form with low gastrointestinal absorption. These findings suggest that modulating gut microbial ecology could complement or partially substitute for systemic chelation in some exposure scenarios.
**Nanotechnology-enabled delivery**. Emerging research explores using nanoparticles (dendrimers, micelles, liposomes) to deliver chelators to specific compartments, including across the blood-brain barrier. A [2025 review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13530-025-00281-9) in Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences surveys these nanotechnology-enabled delivery systems, noting their potential for improved specificity and reduced off-target depletion of essential metals. This work remains largely preclinical, but it represents an active frontier that could eventually allow compartment-specific chelation rather than systemic metal depletion.
**Better molecules**. The structural chemistry work showing that DMSA and DMPS form suboptimal complexes with mercury suggests that improved chelators could be designed with more favorable binding geometry. NBMI represents one attempt in this direction. The broader point is that the current clinical toolkit may not represent the ceiling of what is pharmacologically possible.
Whether future progress comes from better chelators, longer-acting binding agents, compartment-specific strategies, interception approaches, or combinations of these remains an open question.

# Where This Leaves Me

Several questions remain open for me.

On the chemistry side: if DMSA and DMPS form suboptimal complexes with mercury, how much does that matter clinically? The structural chemistry findings are interesting, but people do excrete more mercury when they take these drugs. Whether better-designed molecules would produce better outcomes, or whether the current agents are "good enough" for most purposes, is not something I can answer yet.

On the strategy side: the shuttler concept and the compartmental sequencing logic both make sense in principle, but I have not found robust human data confirming that these approaches outperform simpler protocols. The reasoning is plausible. The evidence base is thin.

On the interception side: the probiotic and nanotechnology work is intriguing but early. Whether gut-level binding can meaningfully reduce body burden in people with existing tissue deposits, or whether it only matters for ongoing exposure, seems like an important distinction that the current literature does not clearly resolve.

I will continue updating this post as I learn more.
