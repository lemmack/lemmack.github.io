Universities have departments of Child Development, usually housed within psychology. They have Developmental Biology, focused primarily on embryogenesis and cellular differentiation. They have Kinesiology for movement, Nutrition for diet, Psychiatry for mental illness, Pediatrics for childhood disease. What they don't have is a field that asks: *How do we cultivate optimally developing humans across all these domains, from conception through adulthood?*

This absence irks me a little. Human development is, by its nature, an integrative phenomenon. A child's cognitive development depends on their nutritional status, their sleep quality, their stress exposure, their movement opportunities, their social environment. These factors don't operate in separate silos within the body; they interact constantly, shaping one another across developmental time. Yet we've organized our institutions as though they can be studied and optimized in isolation.

The closest approximation I've found is Neal Halfon's [Life Course Health Development framework](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2690118/) at UCLA. Halfon argues that health emerges from "multiple determinants operating in nested genetic, biological, behavioral, social, and economic contexts that change as a person develops." His [2018 handbook](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-47143-3) synthesizes research across disciplines, examining how early experiences shape lifelong health trajectories. But even this work exists within public health and pediatrics departments. It remains a *framework* applied to existing medical concerns rather than a field with its own departments, journals, and tenure lines.

Why doesn't this field exist? The more I investigate, the more I find that multiple forces converge to prevent it from emerging.

## The Methodological Problem

Western science advanced through reductionism. Break the system into parts, study parts in isolation, control variables. This approach has been [spectacularly successful](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030208) for certain questions. If you want to understand how a specific enzyme catalyzes a specific reaction, reductionism is your friend.

But integrative questions resist this methodology. You cannot isolate "developmental coherence" as a variable. You cannot run a controlled experiment on "holistic wellbeing across the lifespan." The phenomena that matter most for human flourishing may be precisely those that emerge from interactions between domains and across time, the very interactions that reductionist methods are designed to eliminate.

Systems biology has emerged as a partial corrective, but it carries its own limitations. As one [review notes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2850881/), the field has sometimes served as a rebranding exercise, a way to do integrative work without the baggage that "holism" has acquired. And systems biology still operates primarily at the molecular and cellular level, not at the level of the developing human organism.

Network medicine, pioneered by Albert-László Barabási and Joseph Loscalzo, offers one model for what rigorous integrative methodology might look like. Their work maps how diseases emerge from perturbations across interconnected molecular networks rather than single gene defects. The [Network Medicine Alliance](https://www.network-medicine.org/) now spans over 30 universities, and the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital applies these methods clinically. Yet even network medicine operates primarily at the molecular level, not at the level of the developing human organism across the lifespan.

## The Institutional Problem

Even if integrative methodologies existed and were respected, the institutional structure of universities would resist them.

Funding agencies want operationalizable questions with measurable outcomes. "Does intervention X affect biomarker Y in population Z?" gets funded. "How do structural, biochemical, and psychological coherence interact across critical developmental windows?" does not. The grant application wouldn't even fit the forms.

Tenure committees evaluate candidates based on publications in disciplinary journals, reviewed by disciplinary peers. An integrative thinker publishing across multiple fields appears to be a dilettante, a generalist who hasn't highly specialized in any particular domain. The very breadth that makes integrative work valuable becomes a liability on a CV.

As one [commentary on interdisciplinarity](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/higher-ed-gamma/2025/03/21/humanistic-inquiry-needs-combine-all-their-disciplines) observes, "institutional structures—faculty workloads, promotion and tenure requirements, and departmental budgets—reinforce this fragmentation, prioritizing specialized contributions over interdisciplinary efforts."

And then there's turf. Existing disciplines have institutional interests in maintaining their boundaries. A holistic field of human development would threaten pediatrics, psychiatry, kinesiology, nutrition, developmental psychology. It would claim jurisdiction over questions that currently belong to established departments with established faculty and established budgets. The resistance would be considerable.

The impulse toward integration keeps emerging. The Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health now includes over [86 member institutions](https://imconsortium.org/) including Duke, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale. The VA has rolled out a [Whole Health System](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8902183/) across its medical centers, with early evidence showing meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and reduced opioid use. These are important steps, but even these efforts remain housed within existing departments, framed as complements to conventional care rather than as foundations for a new discipline. Integration gets institutionalized without becoming a field.

## The Historical Problem

There is a darker reason why "optimizing human development" never became a scientific field. The last time Western culture got serious about this project, it ended in forced sterilizations, institutionalizations, and worse.

Eugenics was [mainstream science](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Eugenics-and-Scientific-Racism), supported by leading universities, funded by major foundations, implemented in law across dozens of countries. Its proponents believed they were improving the human species through scientific breeding. What they actually did was weaponize pseudoscience in service of existing prejudices about race, class, and disability.

This history casts a long shadow. Any discourse about "optimizing" or "improving" human development triggers legitimate concern. The question "How do we help humans develop optimally?" can slide, imperceptibly, into "Which humans should be allowed to reproduce?" The boundary between them is not always clear, and the history of eugenics demonstrates how easily it can be crossed.

I suspect this history has created a taboo that suppresses even benign inquiry. The baby got thrown out with the bathwater. We became so (rightly) suspicious of optimization discourse that we abandoned the integrative study of human development altogether. However, I believe that the maturity of the scientific community has increased since the days of eugenics, and that the distinction between cultivation and coercion is now better understood. I think most of the world is now ready for a new integrative science of human development.

## The Reputation Problem

Even setting aside eugenics, "holistic" thinking has acquired disreputable associations. The word itself evokes crystals, chakras, and miracle cures. And there's some justification for the skepticism. Much of what markets itself as "holistic health" lacks rigorous methodology, makes unfalsifiable claims, and preys on desperate people.

But here's the thing: this is, in some respects, a self-fulfilling prophecy.

When academic institutions reject integrative approaches as insufficiently rigorous, integrative thinkers get pushed outside academia. Outside academia, they lack access to peer review, institutional resources, methodological training, and research infrastructure. Their work necessarily becomes less rigorous. Rigor requires institutional support. Academics then point to this lack of rigor as evidence that integrative work is inherently inferior, which justifies continued exclusion.

The question that never gets asked: Is the lack of rigor in "alternative" fields inherent to the approach, or is it a consequence of the exclusion itself?

There's historical precedent for breaking this cycle. Meditation research was considered fringe until contemplative neuroscience emerged with proper imaging technology and institutional backing. Acupuncture was dismissed until properly designed studies found real (if modest and specific) effects. The methodology existed all along. What changed was that mainstream institutions decided these questions were worth asking.

## What Gets Lost

The consequences of this fragmentation show up in clinical practice every day.

A patient with fatigue sees multiple specialists. The cardiologist runs cardiac tests. The endocrinologist checks thyroid function. The psychiatrist evaluates for depression. Each focuses on their domain, and each domain comes back unremarkable. The patient continues to suffer. No one asks whether the fatigue might emerge from the *interaction* between subclinical issues across multiple systems, or from a pattern of dysfunction that no specialist is trained to see.

Among Medicare beneficiaries, [35% see five or more physicians annually](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10923120/). The median beneficiary is treated by eight distinct providers each year. With so many practitioners involved, care fragmentation becomes almost inevitable. Studies find that [moving to a more fragmented region](https://www.nber.org/bah/2017no2/fragmentation-delivery-health-care) is associated with increased hospitalizations, more total visits, and greater healthcare utilization. When primary care becomes fragmented, patients' health deteriorates or they substitute inpatient treatment for conditions that could have been addressed earlier.

This fragmentation is the clinical manifestation of the same institutional forces that prevent an integrative science of human development. We've organized healthcare the way we've organized knowledge: into specialties that don't communicate, disciplines that don't integrate, practitioners who focus on their piece without anyone responsible for the whole.

## Aren't Experts Better Than Generalists?

At this point, a reasonable objection emerges: Why should anyone trust an integrative thinker?

A specialist spends decades mastering one domain. An integrative thinker spreads that time across multiple domains. By simple arithmetic, the integrative thinker knows less about each domain than the specialist. Therefore, the public would be better served by consulting multiple specialists, each providing deep expertise in their area.

This argument contains hidden assumptions worth examining.

**Assumption 1: Knowledge is additive.** If you know more about each part, you know more about the whole. But this ignores emergent properties, interactions, and system-level behaviors that cannot be predicted from parts. A cardiologist, psychiatrist, nutritionist, and physical therapist might each know their domain deeply but collectively miss that the patient's depression, heart palpitations, fatigue, and chronic pain share a common root in dysregulated vagal tone. No specialist is trained to see that pattern.

**Assumption 2: Someone else is doing the integration.** The "consult multiple specialists" model assumes the integration work happens somewhere. Usually it falls to the patient, who has even less expertise than an integrative thinker. Or it falls to the primary care physician, who has fifteen minutes per appointment and no training in synthesis. Either way, it gets done badly or not at all.

**Assumption 3: Synthesis is just diluted expertise.** This is perhaps the most pernicious assumption. It treats integration as merely "knowing less about more things." But synthesis is itself a skill. Identifying patterns across domains, translating between disciplinary languages, recognizing when findings in one field have implications for another, holding multiple frameworks simultaneously without collapsing them... these are cognitive capacities that specialists are not trained in and that institutions do not cultivate.

An integrative thinker will never know as much about biochemistry as a biochemist. The real question is whether integration itself is a form of knowledge that specialists, by definition, cannot provide.

## Ancient Attempts

It's worth noting that integrative approaches to human development are an old idea, one that Western scientific institutions failed to absorb.

Yoga, in its traditional form, was precisely an attempt at integrated human development. I mean the comprehensive system described in texts like the Yoga Sutras, a framework addressing physical structure (asana), breath and energy (pranayama), sensory regulation (pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and their integration into a coherent developmental path. Similar observations could be made about Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, and other systems that attempted to understand the human organism as a whole.

These traditions had significant limitations. They lacked controlled methodology, operated from prescientific cosmologies, and often embedded genuine insight in frameworks that don't survive empirical scrutiny. But they were *trying* to answer the question we've stopped asking: How does everything fit together? How do we cultivate humans who flourish across all dimensions?

When Western science encountered these traditions, it did what reductionist methodology does best: it extracted the parts that could be isolated and tested (meditation reduces cortisol; certain herbs have measurable pharmacological effects) and discarded the integrative framework as mystical nonsense. What got lost was the very thing that made these traditions valuable: the attempt to understand the whole.

## A Path Forward?

The forces preventing an integrative science of human development are structural, historical, and deeply embedded in how we produce and credential knowledge. I can't propose a clean solution. But I can articulate what I think matters.

First, framing. The question "What produces health?" is fundamentally different from "How do we engineer better humans?" One asks about conditions for flourishing; the other demands selection and control. A salutogenic orientation, focused on what creates health rather than what causes disease, offers a way to pursue integrative questions without sliding toward the coercive optimization that discredited eugenics. The coherence framework I've been developing takes this approach: understanding health as the integration of structural, biochemical, and psychological coherence, something that can be cultivated in any human through appropriate conditions.

Second, methodology. Network medicine demonstrates that rigorous integrative methods can exist. The challenge is extending similar approaches beyond the molecular level to the developing human organism across the lifespan. This probably means embracing complexity science, longitudinal designs, n-of-1 studies, and computational modeling of multi-system interactions. It means accepting that some important questions cannot be answered with randomized controlled trials, and developing alternative standards for what counts as evidence.

Third, institutional space. The VA's Whole Health System and the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine show that mainstream institutions can take integrative approaches seriously when given reason to. But integration keeps getting housed within existing departments, framed as a complement to conventional care. Somewhere, some institution needs to try something more ambitious: a program that is integrative in curriculum, methodology, and faculty evaluation. Where synthesis is the core competency, not an afterthought.

Whether these conditions will emerge, I don't know. Until they do, the gap will persist. And so will the costs: the patients who fall through cracks, the children whose development is optimized in one dimension while others atrophy, the collective failure to ask the most important question about human health.

How do we help humans flourish, as whole organisms, across the whole lifespan?

We don't have a science for that yet. Perhaps it's time we built one.
