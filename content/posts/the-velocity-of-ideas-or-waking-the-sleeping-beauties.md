## The Problem of Dormant Knowledge

A lot of human knowledge goes unseen. Even when recorded. Even when technically available. Even when brilliant.

Consider the mathematics of it: [over 3 million peer-reviewed articles are published annually](https://www.embs.org/pulse/articles/using-artificial-intelligence-to-combat-information-overload-in-research/) across more than 30,000 journals, a figure that has been doubling roughly every nine years since World War II. The biomedical field alone sees [over a million papers pour into PubMed each year](https://doi.org/10.1038/nj7612-457a), growing at 8-9% annually. No one can keep up. Not even specialists in narrow subfields.

And what happens to all this knowledge? A significant fraction simply sits there. Citation studies vary in their estimates ([the often-quoted "90% of papers are never cited" appears to be overstated](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/23/academic-papers-citation-rates-remler/)), but the reality is still stark: [approximately 27% of natural science papers, 32% of social science papers, and over 80% of humanities papers](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00142) go uncited within five years of publication. Being uncited is not the same as being unread, and being unread is not the same as being useless. But the broader pattern holds: vast quantities of recorded insight effectively do not exist for most of the people who might benefit from them.

The problem is not just volume. It is mismatched distribution. Important ideas end up in the wrong places, or the right places at the wrong times, or the right places and times but written for the wrong audiences.

## Sleeping Beauties and Their Princes

Bibliometricians have a term for papers that go unnoticed for years or decades before suddenly attracting significant attention: "[sleeping beauties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_with_delayed_recognition)." The metaphor extends to the papers that eventually awaken them, which are called "princes." The terminology was [introduced by van Raan in 2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:SCIE.0000018543.82441.f1).

The phenomenon turns out to be surprisingly common. A [2015 study in *PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1424329112) that analyzed over 22 million papers concluded that sleeping beauties appear even in the work of famous scientists. One striking example: a 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen on quantum mechanics sat largely dormant until 1994, nearly sixty years later, when research on quantum entanglement finally caught up to it. Among the top 15 sleeping beauties in science, the delay for recognition was often 50 to 100 years.

[Gregor Mendel's work on heredity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) is perhaps the most famous case. He published his findings on pea plant genetics in 1866. The paper was [available in at least 120 libraries and scientific institutes](https://www.dnaftb.org/4/bio.html). He corresponded with leading botanists of his time. It made no impact. Then in 1900, three scientists in three different countries independently rediscovered his laws while working on their own hybridization experiments, [all within a two-month span](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/rediscovery-mendels-laws-heredity). The world was finally ready for Mendel, 34 years after publication and 16 years after his death.

What changed? Partly the zeitgeist: Darwin's theory had created new questions about inheritance. Partly technology: microscopy had advanced. Partly the simple accumulation of failed alternatives. But the knowledge itself had been sitting there the entire time, waiting.

The Nobel Prize, interestingly, is sometimes awarded to the "princes" who awaken sleeping beauties, recognizing the value of rediscovery and dissemination as a contribution to science in its own right. [Several Nobel-winning papers were sleeping beauties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242290/) that went unrecognized for an average of nearly 20 years before their awakening.

## Toward a Vocabulary

Here are some terms I find useful for thinking about this problem. Some have existing uses in knowledge management literature; I am adapting them here for a slightly different purpose.

**Knowledge routing** is the active process of connecting specific knowledge with specific people who could use it. It differs from general information retrieval (like a search engine) in that routing implies targeting: getting the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, perhaps even proactively.

**Knowledge velocity** describes how actively a piece of knowledge is moving through networks of potential users. High-velocity knowledge is being cited, taught, discussed, applied. Low-velocity knowledge is at rest, perhaps technically accessible but effectively inert. Velocity implies direction as well as speed: a paper might circulate rapidly within one small community while remaining invisible to adjacent fields where it could be equally or more valuable.

**Knowledge friction** refers to what slows velocity: paywalls, jargon barriers, disciplinary silos, poor indexing, information overload, the sheer difficulty of finding a needle in an exponentially growing haystack.

**Knowledge inertia** captures why dormant knowledge tends to stay dormant. Nobody cites it because nobody has seen it, and nobody sees it because nobody cites it. Once something stops moving, it takes significant energy to get it moving again.

## The Value of Routing Alone

Here is the thought experiment that prompted this post:

Imagine a system that could never generate a single new idea. It could not solve novel problems. It could not synthesize or create. All it could do was route: identify dormant knowledge and deliver it to people who needed it.

Such a system would likely be transformative.

How many researchers are currently working on problems that have already been solved, in a paper they will never find? How many practitioners are using outdated methods because the better approach is buried in a journal they have never heard of? How many entrepreneurs are building products that would work much better if they knew about a technique described in someone's obscure 1987 dissertation?

The sleeping beauty research hints at the scale. If even Nobel Prize-worthy insights can lie dormant for decades, the graveyard of good-but-not-Nobel-worthy ideas must be enormous.

Effective knowledge routing would not require omniscience. Even modest improvements in connecting people to relevant existing knowledge could have compounding effects. A researcher who finds the right paper saves time, builds on solid foundations, and perhaps writes something that helps the next person. Knowledge begets knowledge, but only when it can move.

This is, incidentally, one lens through which to view the potential value of AI systems. Much of the conversation focuses on whether these systems can generate genuinely novel insights. That is an interesting question. But perhaps a more tractable one is whether they can serve as effective princes: awakening sleeping beauties, reducing friction, accelerating the velocity of ideas that already exist but have not yet found their audience. The history of science suggests that this role, however unglamorous, might matter more than we tend to assume.
