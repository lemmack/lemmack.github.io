# Introduction

Aaron Antonovsky's concept of salutogenesis has always struck me as underexplored. His framework proposed that a "Sense of Coherence" is central to human resilience, but the question I keep returning to is whether this coherence has a biological substrate we can actually point to, or whether it remains a purely psychological construct.

Medicine has mapped the pathways of pathogenesis with remarkable precision. We understand, in molecular detail, how things go wrong. The origins of health, the conditions under which the body actively thrives rather than merely avoids disease, remain fuzzier. I've been reading across several fields trying to understand whether there's a physiological foundation for coherence, and three lines of research keep intersecting in ways I find intriguing.

I want to be clear: I'm not a researcher in any of these fields. I have a background in public health and health science, and an interest in how disparate ideas might connect. What follows is an attempt to lay out a question I think is worth asking, point to some relevant science, and see whether the connections I'm noticing hold up to scrutiny. I expect to revise this as I learn more.

# The Structural Question: Biotensegrity

The first thread involves how the body handles mechanical stress. Conventional biomechanics has historically treated the skeleton as a compression structure, with bones stacked and muscles acting as levers. This model has trouble explaining certain things, like how biological systems dissipate force without fracturing, or how quadrupeds support their weight with horizontally oriented spines.

Biotensegrity, a concept developed by orthopedic surgeon Stephen Levin building on Buckminster Fuller's architectural work, proposes an alternative: the body operates as a tension network, with bones floating as compression elements within a continuous web of fascia, tendons, and ligaments. In this model, mechanical forces distribute across the entire system rather than concentrating at joints.

What interests me is the potential downstream implication. If whole-body tensegrity is real, then disruptions to that tensional balance (through disrupted development, injury, chronic postural patterns, scarring) might alter the mechanical environment experienced by cells. This possibility is well-supported at the cellular level. Donald Ingber's work at Harvard has demonstrated that cells sense and respond to mechanical forces through a process called mechanotransduction, with tension on the cytoskeleton influencing gene expression, differentiation, and behavior. The open question is whether macroscopic tensegrity patterns actually propagate down to affect cells in clinically meaningful ways.

Recent work suggests the connection is at least plausible. The biotensegrity literature now frames fascial disruption as a "potential multi-scale pathway linking tissue injury to cellular responses and potentially chronic dysfunction." I haven't found studies that directly test this causal chain in humans, which is part of why I find it worth watching.
There's an interesting internal debate within the biotensegrity community about whether the model adequately accounts for the role of fluids. Some researchers argue that tensegrity principles, while useful, fail to capture how blood, lymph, and interstitial fluid contribute to the body's mechanical behavior. This criticism actually points toward the second thread I've been exploring.

## The Craniofacial Example

One area where the interaction between structure and function becomes especially visible is craniofacial development. The maxilla, the bone forming the upper jaw and mid-face, articulates directly with eleven other cranial bones and influences the position of all the others. It functions as something like a keystone: its development shapes the entire cranial architecture.

The maxilla forms the floor of the nasal cavity and the roof of the mouth. Its width and forward position determine airway volume. Underdevelopment of the maxilla, increasingly common in modern populations, is associated with narrowed airways, sleep-disordered breathing, and compensatory postural changes that cascade through the cervical spine and beyond.

The mainstream framework for understanding this is Melvin Moss's Functional Matrix Theory, which proposes that bone growth responds to the functional demands of surrounding soft tissues. Nasal breathing stimulates lateral maxillary growth; mouth breathing does not. Proper tongue posture and chewing forces shape palatal width. The mechanical environment during development determines adult structure.

Weston Price documented this phenomenon observationally in the 1930s, photographing the facial structures of isolated populations eating traditional diets versus modernized populations eating processed foods. His methodology had significant limitations, and his specific nutritional claims remain contested. His core observation, however, that facial narrowing and dental crowding were largely absent in traditional populations and appeared within a single generation of dietary change, has found support in subsequent research. Contemporary work frames this as primarily an environmental phenomenon: only in the last two or three generations has the human face noticeably retracted and elongated compared to our recent ancestors, with features including lengthening of the face and posterior rotation of the mandible attributed to modern environmental influences.

What makes this relevant to the broader question of coherence is the systemic nature of the effects. Maxillary underdevelopment restricts the airway, which affects sleep quality, which affects metabolic and cognitive function. It alters head posture, which affects cervical spine loading. Research has found correlations between craniocervical angle and patterns of facial growth, suggesting bidirectional relationships between cranial structure and spinal posture. And the maxilla's intimate connection with the sphenoid bone, which houses the pituitary and hypothalamus, raises questions about whether cranial architecture might influence endocrine function through mechanical pathways.

If biotensegrity operates at the whole-body level, the craniofacial complex might be where its effects are most measurable. A well-developed maxilla could be understood as a signal that the tensional network developed under appropriate mechanical loading. The narrow faces and recessed jaws increasingly common in modern populations might indicate that something in our developmental environment is disrupting the mechanical signals that guide healthy growth.

# The Terrain Question: The Extracellular Matrix

If tensegrity describes the body's structural architecture, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interstitial fluid might describe the medium in which cells actually operate. Cranial structure provides a useful bridge here: the skull's architecture directly affects drainage pathways for cerebrospinal fluid and lymph. Restricted cranial development may impair the glymphatic system's ability to clear metabolic waste from the brain during sleep, connecting structural issues to fluid dynamics.

In 2018, researchers at NYU including Neil Theise published findings on the interstitium, a network of fluid-filled spaces supported by collagen bundles found throughout the body. What had previously appeared as dense connective tissue on microscope slides turned out to be an artifact of tissue preparation. When examined in living tissue using confocal laser endomicroscopy, these spaces revealed themselves as an interconnected fluid system. The finding generated significant attention because it suggested we had overlooked a fundamental anatomical structure hiding in plain sight.

Follow-up work in 2021 went further, demonstrating that these interstitial spaces appear to be continuous across tissue and organ boundaries. The researchers tracked particles through interstitial spaces in colon and skin samples and found they could travel into adjacent fascia, suggesting the interstitium may function as an integrated network throughout the body.
This matters because cells don't exist in isolation. They're bathed in interstitial fluid, and the composition and flow characteristics of that fluid affect signaling. The ECM functions as both structural scaffolding and an information-rich environment. Its mechanical properties, particularly stiffness, can influence cell behavior through mechanotransduction pathways. Cells sense matrix stiffness through integrins and respond by altering gene expression, differentiation, and migration.

Research on ECM dynamics has increasingly shown that the mechanical properties of the matrix can actively drive cellular behavior, including pathological behavior. In fibrosis research, for example, matrix stiffening promotes further fibroblast activation, creating feedback loops that perpetuate pathology. A 2018 review put it directly: "Matrix stiffness, traditionally viewed as an end point of organ fibrosis, is now recognized as a critical regulator of tissue fibrogenesis that hijacks the normal physiologic wound-healing program to promote organ fibrosis."

I've been reading Alfred Pischinger's older work on the "Ground Regulation System," which proposed something similar decades ago: that the extracellular space is the primary transit zone of life, and its condition determines cellular health. I'm honestly uncertain how much of Pischinger's framework has held up to modern scrutiny versus how much is historical artifact. The core intuition, that the extracellular environment matters enormously for cellular health, seems increasingly validated by contemporary research on mechanotransduction and matrix biology.

The question I'm circling is whether "matrix coherence," some combination of proper fluid flow, appropriate stiffness, and chemical purity, might be a precondition for cells receiving accurate signals about their environment. Matrix disruption, whether through toxicant accumulation, fibrotic stiffening, or impaired flow, might create a kind of noise that interferes with normal cellular function.

This connects to my interest in [tissue surveillance of persistent toxicants]({{< ref "/posts/tissue-surveillance-of-persistent-toxicants.md" >}}). If the interstitial space is where cells receive their environmental signals, then what accumulates there matters enormously. Lipophilic compounds, heavy metals, and other persistent pollutants that sequester in tissues rather than circulating in blood might exert their effects in part by altering the chemical and mechanical properties of the matrix (in combination with their effects on the cell directly). The body's ability to clear these substances depends on fluid dynamics, on flow through the interstitial spaces and drainage through lymphatic pathways, which brings us back to structural considerations.

# An Interesting Mechanism: Cell Danger Response

The third thread involves how cells translate environmental conditions into metabolic states. Robert Naviaux's work on the Cell Danger Response (CDR) at UC San Diego offers one framework for thinking about this.
Naviaux proposes that mitochondria function as environmental sensors. When they detect threats, whether chemical, microbial, or mechanical, they shift cellular metabolism from energy production toward defense. This makes sense as an acute response to injury or infection. The problem arises when the response becomes chronic. In Naviaux's model, persistent CDR activation creates a hypometabolic state characterized by fatigue, inflammation, and impaired healing.

The CDR unfolds in phases. The initial response involves reduced internal ATP production while ATP is released into the extracellular space as a danger signal. This extracellular ATP binds to purinergic receptors on neighboring cells, promoting inflammation and suppressing repair mechanisms. Subsequent phases involve cellular repair and eventually restoration of normal function. If something prevents progression through these phases, cells remain stuck in a defensive posture.

Naviaux has applied this framework to conditions ranging from chronic fatigue syndrome to autism to long COVID. In a 2024 year-in-review of ME/CFS research, he commented that findings of a hypermetabolic to hypometabolic switch in chronic fatigue patients fit his CDR hypothesis: "In the patients who develop ME/CFS, Long-COVID, and many other hypometabolic, multi-system, chronic fatigue syndromes, mitochondria and cells enter a chronic, but reversible physiologic state that protects the patient and cells from new injuries and chronic threat, but at the expense of a dramatic decrease in functional capacity."

The word "reversible" matters here. Naviaux frames chronic illness as a protective state that persists because the conditions for exiting it haven't been met. The body is waiting for an "all clear" signal that never comes.

What caught my attention is how this might relate to the structural and matrix questions. If mitochondria are monitoring the cellular environment for signs of danger, what signals are they reading? Naviaux emphasizes chemical and microbial threats, and mechanotransduction research suggests cells are also highly attuned to mechanical cues. A stiffened or congested matrix might register as a threat signal. Loss of tensional integrity might create mechanical stress that cells interpret as danger.

Naviaux himself has connected the CDR to environmental health, noting that mitochondria "regulate the CDR by monitoring and responding to the physical, chemical, and microbial conditions within and around the cell. In this way, mitochondria connect cellular health to environmental health." He points to the rising burden of synthetic chemicals in the environment and their presence in human tissues from birth as a potential contributor to the increasing prevalence of chronic illness.

# Where This Stands

I want to be honest about the epistemic status of what I've laid out. Each of these three domains, biotensegrity, ECM/interstitium biology, and the Cell Danger Response, has some empirical support, though they vary in how well-established they are.

Cellular mechanotransduction is well-validated. Cells demonstrably sense and respond to mechanical forces, and the molecular pathways involved (integrins, focal adhesions, YAP/TAZ signaling) are increasingly well-characterized. The extension of tensegrity principles to whole-body biomechanics is more theoretical, with ongoing debate even among proponents about how to model fluid dynamics and visceral contributions. The craniofacial work sits somewhere in between: the association between facial structure and airway function is well-documented, while the broader claims about systemic effects are still being investigated.

The interstitium research is relatively new but published in peer-reviewed journals and generating follow-up work. The broader claims about matrix coherence affecting systemic health are plausible but not yet well-tested. We know matrix stiffness affects cell behavior in culture and in specific disease contexts; whether "matrix health" is a meaningful systemic variable remains to be seen.

Naviaux's CDR framework is a legitimate research program published in journals like Mitochondrion, but it remains a hypothesis rather than established consensus. The specific claim that chronic illness represents "stuck" danger responses is compelling but needs more validation. Naviaux has conducted small clinical trials of antipurinergic therapy for autism with promising results, but larger studies are needed.

These three areas of research are clearly related. Structure affects the mechanical environment of cells. The matrix mediates between structure and cellular function. Cells respond to their environment by adjusting metabolic state. Whether these relationships add up to a coherent model of biological coherence, or whether I'm pattern-matching across domains that happen to share vocabulary, I genuinely don't know.

What I'm looking for as I continue exploring this:

- Evidence that would disconfirm the connections. What findings would suggest tensegrity doesn't affect cellular mechanotransduction at clinically relevant scales? What would indicate matrix properties don't influence metabolic signaling?
- Research that directly tests any link in the chain I've sketched. Are there studies examining whether postural interventions affect matrix properties? Whether matrix-targeted therapies affect fatigue or inflammation?
- Alternative explanations for the phenomena these frameworks are trying to explain. If chronic fatigue isn't a stuck CDR, what is it? If facial structure changes aren't driven by mechanical environment, what's causing them?

I'll update this post as I learn more. If you have expertise in any of these areas and see errors in my understanding, I'd welcome the correction.
