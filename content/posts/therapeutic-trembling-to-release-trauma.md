# Introduction

After escaping a vicious predator attack, a gazelle doesn't resume grazing. It trembles. Its whole body shakes violently for several minutes before it returns to baseline calm. This phenomenon, documented across mammalian species, represents something more than residual fear. It appears to be a biological mechanism for completing the stress response cycle and discharging the massive neurochemical mobilization required for survival.

Humans possess this same tremoring capacity. Yet we rarely allow it to complete. Social conditioning, neocortical override, and the simple fear of appearing "out of control" lead us to suppress these involuntary movements. The hypothesis underlying a growing field of somatic therapies is that this suppression carries a cost: the incomplete discharge of survival energy may contribute to the constellation of symptoms we recognize as post-traumatic stress, chronic tension, and dysregulated arousal.

This piece examines the therapeutic modalities that have emerged to reclaim this ancient biological reset mechanism, from clinically-developed protocols to traditional practices that have utilized shaking for millennia.

# The Premise: Trauma as Incomplete Motor Response

The conceptual foundation shared across these modalities is that trauma is not merely a psychological event but a physiological one. When threat triggers the fight-or-flight response, the body mobilizes enormous resources: catecholamines flood the system, blood shunts to skeletal muscles, and motor plans for defensive action begin firing. If these responses are thwarted (by physical restraint, overwhelming force, or developmental powerlessness), the mobilized energy has nowhere to go.

Dr. Peter Levine, developer of Somatic Experiencing, characterizes this as an "incomplete motor plan" in his foundational text [Waking the Tiger](https://www.northatlanticbooks.com/shop/waking-the-tiger-healing-trauma/). The neural instructions to run, kick, or scream continue firing in the brainstem, but motor output is inhibited. This creates what some clinicians describe as a state of "high-energy co-activation": one foot on the accelerator (sympathetic charge) and one on the brake (parasympathetic immobilization).

The animal "shake-off" represents the completion of this motor plan. It allows the nervous system to metabolize the potential energy and signal to the midbrain that the organism has survived and the threat has passed.

# A Spectrum of Approaches

Modern therapeutic applications of shaking and vibration span a continuum from active to passive, from clinician-guided to self-directed:

**Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises (TRE)**, [developed by David Berceli](https://treglobal.org/about-dr-david-berceli/), occupies a middle ground: a structured seven-exercise protocol designed to fatigue specific muscle groups (particularly the kinetic chain of the legs and the psoas) until a tremor reflex activates. Once tremoring begins, the individual allows the body to shake itself without conscious direction.

**Somatic Experiencing (SE)** relies on organic, internally-generated release. Rather than exercises, a therapist guides the client to track bodily sensations. As awareness touches trapped survival energy, the body may spontaneously begin to twitch or tremble. This approach emphasizes careful titration to prevent overwhelming the client's integrative capacity.

**Bioenergetic Analysis**, developed by Alexander Lowen in the 1950s and detailed in his [1975 book of the same name](https://archive.org/details/bioenergetics00alex/page/n5/mode/2up), represents the more active end of the spectrum. Clients hold challenging "stress positions" designed to induce tremors through fatigue and stress, often accompanied by emotional expression.

**Whole-Body Vibration (WBV)** occupies the passive, exogenous end. Mechanical platforms deliver high-frequency oscillations that stimulate mechanoreceptors and induce reflexive muscle contractions. Originally developed to address [bone density loss in cosmonauts](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9925023/), WBV is increasingly investigated for mental health applications.

Traditional practices also occupy this landscape. [Qigong shaking exercises](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3085832/) have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine to promote energy flow and release stagnation. Shamanic traditions across cultures, from the Kalahari San trance dances to the historical Shakers in America, have employed ecstatic shaking for healing and spiritual release.

# Proposed Mechanisms

Several physiological pathways may explain why inducing tremors could resolve chronic tension and traumatic stress:

**Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)**: These neuronal circuits in the spinal cord and brainstem can produce rhythmic motor patterns without cortical input. Originally demonstrated by [Thomas Graham Brown in 1911](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017308000672) through experiments showing that cats with severed descending inputs and sensory feedback could still produce rhythmic stepping, CPGs have since been [confirmed across all vertebrate species](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2012.00183) from lampreys to humans.

The hypothesis that neurogenic tremors may be mediated by CPGs is speculative but plausible. CPGs are known to control rhythmic behaviors including locomotion, respiration, mastication, and scratching. [Calancie et al. (1994)](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/117.5.1143) documented what they called "the first well-defined example of a central rhythm generator for stepping in the adult human" in a patient with cervical spinal cord injury who exhibited involuntary stepping movements when lying supine. If therapeutic tremoring similarly engages subcortical CPG circuits, this would distinguish it from pathological tremors originating in the basal ganglia or cerebellum, and might explain why the movements feel involuntary yet non-threatening.

**Gamma Loop Recalibration**: The gamma motor neuron system regulates the[ baseline sensitivity of muscle spindles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10959/), and the [Johansson/Sojka hypothesis](https://doi.org/10.1067/mmt.2000.109674) proposes that nociceptive input and metabolic stress can create positive feedback loops that maintain elevated muscle tone. Rhythmic oscillation may help interrupt these habitual feedback patterns, allowing the spinal cord to recalibrate gamma motor neuron firing to a lower baseline.

**Fascial Mechanotransduction**: Recent research has reclassified fascia from passive connective tissue to a richly innervated sensory organ. The body-wide fascial network contains an estimated 250 million nerve endings, compared to approximately 200 million in the skin, potentially making it the body's [largest sensory organ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319182467_FASCIA_AS_A_SENSORY_ORGAN_Clinical_Applications). 

Fascia contains four types of mechanoreceptors responsive to mechanical stimulation: Golgi organs, Ruffini receptors, Pacini corpuscles, and interstitial receptors. Approximately [80% of sensory nerve endings](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1360-8592(02)00067-0) in fascial tissues are free nerve endings. Of these, 90% are connected to slowly conducting unmyelinated C-fiber neurons. Functional MRI studies have shown that stimulation of these C-fiber neurons [activates the insular cortex](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7020-3425-1.00047-7) rather than the primary somatosensory cortex, indicating a clear interoceptive role. This anatomical arrangement suggests fascia plays a significant role in interoception, the sense of the body's internal state that is increasingly linked to emotional processing and trauma.

Research has demonstrated that people with chronic lower back pain have fascia that shows approximately [20% reduced shear strain (gliding ability)](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2474-12-203) in the lumbar and thoracic spine, and they also show poorer proprioception. Chronic sympathetic activation leads to fascial densification through [cytokine signaling, particularly TGF-beta-1](https://doi.org/10.2741/870), potentially distorting interoceptive signals to the insular cortex. Vibration and trembling may help restore fascial hydration and improve interoceptive accuracy.


# Evidence Status

The evidence base for these modalities is heterogeneous and generally preliminary:

For **TRE**, the evidence base is growing but remains preliminary. [Parker et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.4236/psych.2024.151006) conducted an 8-week intervention with East African refugees resettled in the United States. Using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the treatment group showed significant reductions in symptom severity on 36 of 40 items compared to a delayed-treatment control group, with significant reductions in both overall symptom severity and number of symptoms experienced.

In a [2021 exploratory pilot study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcme.2021.02.003), Lynning et al. tested a 9-week TRE program with nine people with Multiple Sclerosis. Mean fatigue scores on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale decreased from 43.7 (SD = 13.6) to 22.0 (SD = 12.3), approximately a 50% reduction. Participants also reported improvements in sleep quality and stress levels, with statistically significant decreases in eight of nine self-reported MS symptoms.

A subsequent [2025 randomized controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40064004/) by Skovgaard et al. with 28 MS participants found that when adjusting for baseline covariate imbalance, positive effects emerged for fatigue, spasticity, and pain. However, the unadjusted primary analysis did not reach significance, highlighting the importance of larger, adequately powered trials.

For **Somatic Experiencing**, the [Brom et al. (2017) randomized controlled trial](https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22189) remains the most rigorous study to date. Sixty-three participants meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for PTSD were randomly assigned to 15 weekly SE sessions or waitlist control. The intervention produced large effect sizes for PTSD symptom severity (Cohen's d = 0.94 to 1.26) and depression (Cohen's d = 0.7 to 1.08), with gains maintained at 15-week follow-up.

To contextualize these findings: [Cohen's conventions](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155) classify effect sizes above 0.8 as "large," meaning the SE treatment group's improvement was roughly 0.9 to 1.3 standard deviations better than controls. In practical terms, a Cohen's d of 1.0 means approximately [84% of the treatment group](https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/) scored above the control group mean. These effect sizes are comparable to or larger than those found in meta-analyses of established PTSD treatments.

However, important limitations apply: the study used a waitlist control (meaning participants knew whether they received treatment), the sample size was modest, and SE has not yet been directly compared against active control conditions like prolonged exposure or EMDR in adequately powered trials.

For **Whole-Body Vibration**, [a 2022 randomized controlled trial](https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2022.72) found significant improvements in depression, stress, and emotional well-being among college students compared to controls. [A 2021 RCT](https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7593802) found that six weeks of WBV significantly increased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in women with fibromyalgia.

For **traditional practices** like Qigong shaking and shamanic trance, evidence is primarily ethnographic and experiential, drawing on centuries of use rather than controlled trials.

# Important Caveats

The enthusiasm surrounding these modalities must be tempered by several considerations:

**Theoretical controversy**: Polyvagal Theory, which provides much of the theoretical scaffolding for somatic trauma therapy, faces substantial critique. Paul Grossman's [2023 systematic review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2023.108589) in *Biological Psychology* argues that "there is broad consensus among experts that each basic physiological assumption of the polyvagal theory is untenable," challenging all five core premises of the theory. [Neuhuber and Berthoud (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2022.108425) similarly conclude that the theory's "basic phylogenetic and functional-anatomical tenets do not withstand closer scrutiny."

The specific points of contention include: whether the dorsal and ventral vagal nuclei have the distinct functional roles Porges proposes; whether respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) serves as a valid index of "cardiac vagal tone"; and whether the evolutionary timeline placing myelinated vagal pathways as uniquely mammalian is accurate, given [evidence of myelinated vagal fibers in lungfish](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaq0800).

Porges has responded to these critiques, arguing that critics have misrepresented the theory and that their objections do not engage with PVT as actually articulated in his foundational papers ([Porges, 2025](https://doi.org/10.36131/cnfioritieditore20250301)). The debate remains active in the scientific literature.

This controversy matters for clinical practice because many somatic trauma therapies invoke polyvagal concepts to explain their effects. However, the clinical observations these therapies are built upon may remain valid regardless of whether the specific neuroanatomical explanations prove correct. Therapists working in this space should be aware that they are operating with contested theoretical scaffolding, even as they report clinical success.

**Risk of flooding**: Intensity does not equal healing. Discharge that is too rapid or violent can overwhelm integrative capacity, potentially reinforcing trauma pathways rather than resolving them. Practitioners consistently emphasize titration: short sessions, stopping before relief is complete, remaining within the "window of tolerance."

**Contraindications**: These modalities are not universally appropriate. Reported contraindications include pregnancy, epilepsy, recent surgery, active psychosis, and unstable cardiovascular conditions. For WBV specifically, pacemakers represent a concern.

**Evidence limitations**: Most studies remain small, often lack active control conditions, and follow-up periods are typically brief. The field awaits larger-scale trials comparing these approaches directly against established treatments.

# Preliminary Synthesis

The reintegration of shaking and vibration into therapeutic practice represents a recognition that humans are physiological animals, subject to biological laws of threat and recovery that we share with other mammals. The capacity to "shake it off" appears to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that social and cognitive constraints have largely suppressed.

Whether accessed through structured exercises, guided somatic awareness, mechanical platforms, or traditional ritual, these modalities share a common premise: that completing the body's interrupted survival responses may resolve symptoms that cognitive approaches alone cannot reach.

The evidence is early but accumulating. The theoretical frameworks remain contested but clinically useful. The risks are real but manageable with appropriate titration and screening.

For those interested in exploring this territory, the prudent path involves starting small, seeking qualified guidance, and maintaining appropriate skepticism while remaining open to what the body may know that the mind has forgotten.
