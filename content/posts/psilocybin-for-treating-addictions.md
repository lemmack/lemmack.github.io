Addiction is often described as a hijacking of the brain's reward circuitry, but that framing isn't the full story. It ignores the psychological rigidity that keeps people trapped in patterns they desperately want to escape. This is where psilocybin research has started to capture serious scientific attention. Rather than targeting withdrawal symptoms or blocking receptors the way conventional treatments do, psilocybin-assisted therapy appears to work by loosening the brain's habitual grooves, allowing people to step outside entrenched thought patterns and, in some cases, fundamentally reorient their relationship with a substance.

The strongest clinical evidence so far centers on alcohol use disorder and tobacco dependence. A randomized controlled trial published in JAMA Psychiatry found that psilocybin therapy significantly reduced heavy drinking days compared to active placebo, with effects persisting months after just one or two dosing sessions. For smoking cessation, pilot studies from Johns Hopkins have reported abstinence rates around 80% at six-month follow-up, figures that dwarf the roughly 30% success rates typical of nicotine replacement therapies. These are early-stage findings and the sample sizes remain small, but the effect sizes have been striking enough to attract sustained research investment.

This post will track how the science develops. I'm particularly interested in watching whether the promising results from alcohol and tobacco trials extend to opioid use disorder, where trials are currently underway but completed data remains sparse. I'll also be following the mechanistic research: what does it mean that treatment success correlates with the intensity of "mystical experience" during sessions? And how do proposed mechanisms like default mode network disruption and enhanced neuroplasticity actually translate into lasting behavioral change?
