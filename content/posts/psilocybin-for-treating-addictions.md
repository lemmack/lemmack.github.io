# Introduction

Addiction is often described as a hijacking of the brain's reward circuitry, but that framing isn't the full story. At play is also a certain psychological rigidity that keeps people trapped in patterns they want to escape. This is where psilocybin research has started to capture serious scientific attention. Rather than targeting withdrawal symptoms or blocking receptors the way conventional treatments do, psilocybin-assisted therapy appears to work by loosening the brain's habitual grooves, allowing people to step outside entrenched thought patterns and, in some cases, fundamentally reorient their relationship with a substance.

The strongest clinical evidence so far centers on alcohol use disorder and tobacco dependence. [A randomized controlled trial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2096) published in JAMA Psychiatry found that participants receiving psilocybin therapy averaged 9.7% heavy drinking days compared to 23.6% in the placebo group, with effects persisting months after just one or two dosing sessions. For smoking cessation, pilot studies from Johns Hopkins have reported biologically verified abstinence rates around 80% at six-month follow-up. As a benchmark, [pooled analyses](https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006103.pub7) place varenicline, the most effective approved pharmacotherapy, at roughly 25% continuous abstinence at six months or longer. These are early-stage findings and the sample sizes remain small, but the effect sizes have been striking enough to attract sustained research investment.

This post will track how the science develops. I'm particularly interested in watching whether the promising results from alcohol and tobacco trials extend to opioid use disorder, where trials are currently underway but completed data remains sparse. I'll also be following the mechanistic research: what does it mean that treatment success correlates with the intensity of "mystical experience" during sessions? And how do proposed mechanisms like default mode network disruption and enhanced neuroplasticity actually translate into lasting behavioral change?

# Current Therapeutic Science

## Alcohol Use Disorder

The most rigorous evidence for psilocybin in addiction treatment comes from [a 2022 randomized controlled trial](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2096) published in JAMA Psychiatry, led by Michael Bogenschutz at NYU Langone. The study enrolled 93 adults with alcohol use disorder and ran for eight months, comparing psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy against an active placebo (diphenhydramine, an antihistamine).

The protocol matters here. This wasn't simply "take psilocybin and see what happens." Participants in both arms received 12 weeks of manualized psychotherapy, with dosing sessions at weeks 4 and 8. The psilocybin group received 25 mg/70 kg in their first session, with the option to increase to 30-40 mg/70 kg in the second. Each dosing session lasted an entire day, with two therapists present throughout, monitoring blood pressure and heart rate while providing psychological support. Preparation sessions preceded the dosing, and integration sessions followed.

The headline result is clearer in absolute terms than in percentage reductions. During the 32-week double-blind follow-up, the psilocybin group averaged 9.7% heavy drinking days versus 23.6% in the active placebo (diphenhydramine) group (a 13.9 percentage-point difference). If you express that as a relative reduction from screening, it works out to roughly an 83% reduction vs about 51%, but the absolute numbers are easier to interpret and compare across studies.

Abstinence is also more nuanced than a single headline number. Across the full follow-up window (weeks 5–36), 22.9% of the psilocybin group met the study’s abstinence criterion versus 8.9% in the placebo group (P = 0.06). In the final month (weeks 33–36), abstinence was 47.9% vs 24.4% (P = 0.02). The trial also reported no serious adverse events among participants who received psilocybin.

What makes this trial particularly credible is the active placebo design. The diphenhydramine produced noticeable effects (drowsiness, dry mouth), making it harder for participants to guess which group they were in. Earlier psychedelic studies often used inert placebos, raising concerns that participants in the treatment arm knew they'd received the real drug and responded accordingly. The Bogenschutz trial wasn't perfectly blinded, but it was a meaningful improvement.

A larger follow-up trial is now underway, with Bogenschutz leading a multi-site study that aims to replicate and extend these findings. If results hold, psilocybin could become the first new pharmacological treatment for alcohol use disorder in decades.

### A Patient Perspective

To put a human face on these statistics: [Jon Kostas](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/participant-on-life-changing-sobriety-7-years-after-psychedelics-study-there-are-no-words-147370053549) entered the NYU psilocybin trial in 2015 at age 25, after years of severe binge drinking that had resisted multiple rehab stints, AA, and every medication his doctors tried. He was, by his own description and his physicians' assessment, drinking himself to death. He received two psilocybin doses over the course of the trial, embedded in 12 sessions of psychotherapy.

What strikes me about Kostas's account is how he describes the change. He didn't white-knuckle his way to sobriety. He stopped drinking immediately after his first psilocybin session and reports that his cravings simply vanished. In interviews, he's described feeling "indifferent" to alcohol afterward, as though the compulsion had been surgically removed. He hasn't had a drink since 2015 and no longer identifies as an alcoholic.

This matches a pattern researchers have noted across psilocybin addiction studies: treatment success often correlates with participants reporting profound "mystical" or perspective-shifting experiences during their sessions. The mechanism remains unclear, but something about the experience appears to loosen the grip of compulsive patterns in ways that conventional treatments often fail to achieve. Kostas has since founded a nonprofit, the Apollo Pact, advocating for federal funding of psychedelic research. He's been careful to distinguish clinical psilocybin-assisted therapy from recreational use, warning that people shouldn't expect the same results from mushrooms obtained outside a medical setting.

## Tobacco Dependence

The smoking cessation research comes primarily from Matthew Johnson's group at Johns Hopkins. Their 2014 pilot study (with [follow-up in 2017](https://doi.org/10.3109/00952990.2016.1170135)) has become something of a landmark, though it's important to understand what it was and wasn't.

The study was small and open-label, meaning there was no control group and everyone knew they were receiving psilocybin. Fifteen participants enrolled, all long-term smokers who had tried and failed to quit multiple times. The average participant was 51 years old, had smoked 19 cigarettes per day for 31 years, and had attempted to quit six times previously. These were not casual smokers looking for an easy out. They were people for whom conventional approaches had repeatedly failed.

The treatment combined psilocybin with cognitive behavioral therapy specifically designed for smoking cessation. Participants received two to three psilocybin sessions (at moderate to high doses of 20-30 mg/70 kg) as part of a structured 15-week program that included weekly counseling.

At six-month follow-up, 80% of participants met biologically verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (verified with breath/urine measures, not just self-report). That is a striking signal, but it’s worth naming the exact abstinence definition because “point-prevalence” is different from “continuous abstinence since quit date.”

As a benchmark, varenicline (Chantix) is among the most effective pharmacotherapies, but pooled evidence summaries often place 6+ month quit rates in the low-to-mid 20% range for many settings, depending on the exact endpoint and how much behavioral support is provided.

Long-term follow-up data, published in 2017, showed the effects were durable. At 12 months, 67% remained abstinent. At an average of 30 months post-treatment, 60% were still not smoking. For a single treatment intervention in a population of chronic relapsers, these numbers are remarkable.

The obvious caveat is sample size. Fifteen people is not enough to draw firm conclusions about efficacy. The absence of a control group means we can't rule out that participants quit because they believed the treatment would work, or because the intensive psychotherapy alone was responsible, or because some other factor we haven't identified was doing the heavy lifting. Placebo effects in addiction treatment can be substantial.

What the pilot study did establish is that the approach is feasible and safe enough to warrant larger trials. In 2021, the NIH awarded the first federal grant in over 50 years for psychedelic research, funding a multi-site randomized controlled trial of psilocybin for smoking cessation led by Johnson's team at Hopkins, with sites at NYU and University of Alabama at Birmingham. That trial is now underway.

While the double-blind trial continues, interim data from a separate open-label comparison study offers additional signal. That study randomized participants to psilocybin-assisted therapy or nicotine patch, both combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. With 44 participants reaching the 12-month mark (22 per group), biologically verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was 59% in the psilocybin group versus 27% for nicotine patch. These numbers will shift as enrollment continues toward the target of roughly 80 participants, but they suggest the pilot findings were not a fluke.

One intriguing finding from the pilot: abstinence correlated with the intensity of participants' "mystical experiences" during psilocybin sessions. Those who reported profound, transcendent experiences were more likely to quit successfully than those who had milder trips. This mirrors patterns seen in other psilocybin research, and it raises questions about mechanism. Is psilocybin working through some direct neurobiological effect, or is the psychological experience itself doing the therapeutic work? The answer matters for how these treatments might eventually be optimized and delivered.

## Opioid Use Disorder

As for opioid use disorder, the research is just beginning. No large-scale randomized controlled trials have been completed, so we don't yet have the kind of evidence that exists for alcohol and tobacco. What we do have is active investigation: researchers at UW-Madison launched what they describe as the first psilocybin trial specifically for opioid use disorder in 2021, and Imperial College London received government funding in late 2024 for a UK trial focused on preventing relapse in people who have recently completed opioid detox. The Imperial team notes that up to 90% of people relapse within 12 months of finishing detox, making this a particularly high-stakes population to study. Johns Hopkins has also listed opioid addiction among its upcoming psilocybin research priorities. These trials are still recruiting or in early stages, so expect a lag of several years before we see published results comparable to the alcohol data.

# Proposed Mechanisms

The clinical results raise an obvious question: how does a drug taken once or twice produce effects that last months or years? Two overlapping explanations have emerged from neuroimaging and molecular research, though neither is yet definitive.

The first centers on the default mode network, a set of brain regions active during self-referential thought, mind-wandering, and autobiographical memory. In addiction, the DMN appears to reinforce rigid, repetitive patterns of thinking. Psilocybin temporarily disrupts this network. A [2024 study in Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07624-5) tracked healthy adults with precision brain imaging before, during, and after psilocybin administration. The researchers found that psilocybin massively disrupted functional connectivity across the cortex and subcortex, with the largest effects in the default mode network. More striking, some changes persisted: functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and the DMN remained reduced for weeks after a single dose. The authors propose this persistent suppression may represent a neuroanatomical correlate of psilocybin's therapeutic effects, essentially a loosening of the brain's habitual self-referential loops.

The second explanation involves neuroplasticity. Animal studies have shown that psilocybin promotes dendritic spine growth in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, regions involved in learning and behavioral flexibility. The thinking is that the acute disruption of normal brain activity triggers a homeostatic response, upregulating plasticity-related genes like BDNF and allowing new neural connections to form during the days and weeks that follow. This could explain why a single dose produces lasting effects: the drug opens a window for rewiring, and the therapeutic context (preparation, the experience itself, integration) shapes what gets built.

These mechanisms may also help explain the correlation between "mystical experience" and treatment outcomes. Researchers measure mystical experience using standardized questionnaires that assess feelings of unity, transcendence of time and space, and a sense of sacredness or profound meaning. Across multiple studies, participants who score higher on these measures show better outcomes. One interpretation is that the intensity of DMN disruption during the session, which produces the subjective sense of ego dissolution and expanded awareness, predicts the degree of subsequent neuroplastic change. The experience and the biology may be two sides of the same process.

One complication worth noting: the brain's response to psilocybin may differ in people with established addiction. A [2023 study in rats](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02690-1) found that psilocybin-induced DMN disruption was blunted in alcohol-dependent animals, particularly those with more severe relapse patterns. The researchers attributed this to "anaplasticity," a loss of the brain's normal capacity to respond to plasticity-inducing stimuli after prolonged addiction. If this translates to humans, it could help explain why some patients respond dramatically to psilocybin while others see more modest effects. It also suggests that timing may matter: intervening earlier in addiction, before anaplasticity sets in, might produce better outcomes.

# The Importance of Context

The clinical results above come with a crucial caveat: they emerge from tightly controlled therapeutic environments, and those environments do substantial work. Participants in these trials don't simply take psilocybin and go about their day. The Bogenschutz alcohol study, for example, embedded two psilocybin sessions within 12 weeks of psychotherapy, including multiple preparation sessions before dosing and integration sessions afterward. The drug and the therapy function as a package.

This matters because psilocybin carries real risks that the clinical protocols are designed to mitigate. Trials rigorously screen out anyone with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, as psychedelics can trigger or worsen psychosis in vulnerable individuals. Bipolar disorder, particularly Bipolar I, is also typically an exclusion criterion. The concern here is that psychedelics may provoke manic or psychotic episodes in people with these predispositions.

Beyond screening, the trials emphasize what researchers call "set and setting": the participant's mindset and expectations going in, and the physical and interpersonal environment during the session. Dosing sessions last six to eight hours, with two trained therapists present throughout, blood pressure monitored, and a carefully prepared room with eye masks and curated music. This therapeutic container is considered essential to the outcomes. Someone taking psilocybin recreationally, without screening, preparation, or professional support, should not expect the same results and may face elevated risks.

# The Canadian Landscape

For Canadian readers following this research, the regulatory picture here is more permissive than in the United States, though still far from simple.

Psilocybin remains a controlled substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. It has no approved therapeutic indications in Canada and cannot be legally possessed, produced, or sold without authorization. But since 2020, Health Canada has opened two pathways for legal therapeutic access: individual Section 56 exemptions and the Special Access Program.

The first Section 56 exemptions were granted in August 2020, when Health Minister Patty Hajdu approved four terminally ill cancer patients to use psilocybin for end-of-life distress. These were the first legal medical exemptions for psilocybin in Canada since the substance was scheduled in 1974. The nonprofit TheraPsil, based in Victoria, has been the primary facilitator of these exemptions, supporting dozens of patients and healthcare practitioners through the application process. By late 2021, TheraPsil had helped secure exemptions for 39 patients and 19 healthcare professionals (the latter for experiential training purposes).

In January 2022, Health Canada amended the Special Access Program (SAP) to include psilocybin and MDMA as "restricted drugs" that physicians could request for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when other treatments have failed. The SAP is designed for case-by-case compassionate access, and Health Canada has named end-of-life distress and treatment-resistant major depressive disorder as conditions within scope for psilocybin requests. 

By February 2024, Health Canada had authorized 176 Canadians to access psilocybin through the SAP, with a reported approval rate around 78%. More recently, public reporting suggests that, from January 2022 through November 2024, Health Canada received 471 SAP requests involving psilocybin and/or MDMA and authorized 318 (about 68%), underscoring both growing demand and meaningful friction in access. (These figures mix substances and time windows, so I’d treat them as directional unless Health Canada publishes psilocybin-only breakdowns for the same period.)

Notably, the SAP requires that psilocybin be administered in the presence of a practitioner or their delegate. Patients cannot take it home. This mirrors the clinical trial model where the drug is part of a supervised therapeutic session, though the SAP pathway does not mandate any specific psychotherapy protocol.

The legal situation has remained contested. In May 2024, the Federal Court required Health Canada to reconsider a denied SAP request involving psilocybin for cluster headaches. In June 2025, the Federal Court of Appeal set aside Health Canada decisions denying exemptions sought by healthcare practitioners for experiential training, faulting the decision-making for inadequate justification and requiring redetermination. TheraPsil has also launched a Charter challenge arguing that restricted access to psilocybin violates patients' Section 7 rights to life, liberty, and security of the person, following the legal template that eventually led to medical cannabis regulations.


On the research side, Canada has become an active site for psilocybin-addiction trials. In June 2023, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research announced nearly $3 million in funding for three clinical trials examining psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for alcohol use disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and end-of-life psychological distress in cancer patients.

The most advanced Canadian addiction trial was being run by Vancouver-based Clairvoyant Therapeutics, which conducted a Phase 2b study of psilocybin for alcohol use disorder across 12 sites in Canada and Europe. The trial enrolled 154 participants and completed dosing in 2024, with topline results expected in early 2025. Clairvoyant had stated its goal was to become the first company in the world to commercialize clinically validated psilocybin treatment, pursuing conditional marketing authorization (NOC/c in Canada) if results proved positive. However, in September 2024, Nasdaq-listed Psyence Biomedical announced a conditional agreement to acquire Clairvoyant. That deal fell through in October 2024 after due diligence, and Clairvoyant's current status and plans for releasing trial results remain unclear. The data from that 154-participant trial, if eventually published, would still represent a meaningful addition to the evidence base.

Separately, the University of Calgary launched what it describes as Canada's largest single-site psilocybin trial in 2024, led by Dr. Leah Mayo, investigating psilocybin combined with motivational enhancement therapy for alcohol use disorder. Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre are also running a Phase 2b trial for AUD in partnership with Clairvoyant.

The practical reality for most Canadians is that legal psilocybin therapy remains difficult to access. The SAP pathway requires a physician willing to navigate the application process, and not all applications are approved. There is no public insurance coverage for psilocybin-assisted therapy. The nonprofit sector (TheraPsil, Roots to Thrive) continues to help patients pursue exemptions, but capacity is limited. Meanwhile, unlicensed psilocybin dispensaries have proliferated in major cities, operating in a legal gray zone with inconsistent enforcement. For example, one Ontario-focused analysis identified 57 illegal mushroom dispensaries operating as of May 2024. This mirrors the pre-legalization cannabis landscape and suggests public demand is outpacing the regulatory framework.

For the purposes of this post, the key takeaway is that Canada is both further along in compassionate access than the United States and actively generating its own clinical trial data. Whether the Clairvoyant data eventually becomes public remains to be seen, but the University of Calgary and Queen's University trials continue, and Canada remains well-positioned to generate its own clinical evidence for psilocybin in alcohol use disorder.
